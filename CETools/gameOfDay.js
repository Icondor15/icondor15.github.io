Making a Stardust will not save your current score. When going for the PO, be sure to pick the \"Make a Star/Constellation\" option, otherwise your score won't be saved. Be aware that when Making a Star/Constellation your previous score will be deleted and you may lose progress for the PO. For example, if you obtained a Super Clear on the Cancer Constellation, and then you replay the level and finish it with a worse score, if you pick \"Make a Constellation\" then your current score will be saved, and you'll lose the Super Clear on that Constellation, forcing you to replay the level again for the Super Clear."
